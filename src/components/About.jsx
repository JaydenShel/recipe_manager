            Keeping track of recipes can be a daunting task. Physical recipe cards are easily misplaced,
            digital bookmarks can become cluttered, and finding the perfect recipe to fit your needs and
            ingredients is often be challenging. Our recipe manager is designed with one goal in mind: to
            simplify and organize your favorites recipes. We achieve this by allowing the user to create a
            personalized account and import their own unique recipes that can be easily sorted.
